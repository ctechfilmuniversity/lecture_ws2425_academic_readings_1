## Visual Layout

--

* Don‚Äôt clutter your slides

--
    * Just add more slides!

---
.header[Layout]

## Visual Layout

* I will dive straight into the problem, assuming you know as much as I do about the topic in general and the specific problems I‚Äôm trying to solve in particular
* I will throw my solutions at you without a warning, without any motivation, or any insight about the key observations that lead to the proposed solution
* I will also write Every. Single. Word. I will articulate, thus limiting myself to simply reading the slides, while filling the space with lots and lots of words that you may or may not read but hey words are free right? So why not keep typing until I simply run out of space and then I‚Äôll just add a new slide and continue
* My solution could make the world a better place but no-one will know about my ideas because I gave such a bad presentation that made everybody dislike the topic.
